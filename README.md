# Nightmare Spark
A mod for Hollow Knight.


Adds a new charm that causes dashing to leave behind a trail of Nightmare Flame, includes several charm synergies.


Return to the Nightmare Lantern upon completion of either ending to the Grimm Troupe questline to recieve your reward!
Charm can also be acquired with Debug Mods "Give All Charms" button/keybind, by starting a new Godseeker save, or by editing the local save settings for the save.


* Flukenest: Replaces the fluke spell with a burst of 3 firebats that deal considerable damage. Damage is buffed by Shamans Stone.
* Flukenest + Defenders Crest: Fires a single massive, slow-moving firebat that causes a huge explosion on impact.  Damage is not effected by shamans stone
* Dash Master: Decreases the cooldown time for the flame trail.
* Sprint Master*: Adds a rain of fireballs at the start of the dive spell. Fireball count and damage scale with spell level, 5 fireballs at level 1 and 7 at level 2 
* Shape of Unn: The Knight becomes a bat and can fly around untill the focus finishes. Speed of the bat and range scales with deep focus & quick focus 
* Carefree Melody: Activating Carefree's shield will spawn a ring of grimm spikes that eject outward from the spot the shield procced dealing damage
* Carefree Melody + Thorns of Agony: Activating Carefree's shield wills spawn a ring of nightmare spikes that eject outwards from the spot the shield procced dealing extra damage
* Grimmchild: Increase Grimmchild enemy detection range by 50%. Every 3rd shot Grimmchild fires will have 1 of 3 effects based on distance from it's target.
* 1. At close range Grimmchild will fire a larger fireball that will explode into a pillar of fire on impact.
* 2. At medium range Grimmchild will fire 4 extra fireballs for a total of 5 in a volley of 3 then 2.
* 3. At long range Grimmchild will eject a spiral of fireballs 

\* Currently unsure which charm to tie this ability to, consider it a placeholder of sorts

!KNOWN ISSUES!
- The audio effect for launching fire bats is NOT effected by the in-game volume sliders, it's volume has been drastically lowered to account for this.
- The charm will NOT spawn into the world in saves created before the mod was installed, only in new saves. Use debug mod or edit the local save settings to get around this.
- Grimmchild's pillar synergy will sometimes not proc on the third hit if grimmchild is too close to the target, however the next hit will spawn the fire pillar.
