A mod for Hollow Knight.

Adds a new charm that causes dashing to leave behind a trail of Nightmare Flame, includes several charm synergies.

Flukenest: Replaces the fluke spell with a burst of 3 fire bats that deal considerable damage. Damage is buffed by Shamans Stone.<br>
Grimmchild: Grimmchild deals 50% more damage.<br>
Dash Master: Decreases the cooldown time for the flame trail.<br>
??? (No charm): Adds a rain of fireballs at the start of the dive spell. Fireball count and damage scale with spell level, 5 fireballs at level 1 and 7 at level 2 <br>
Shape of Unn: The Knight becomes a bat and can fly around untill the focus finishes. Speed of the bat scales with deep focus & quick focus <br>
